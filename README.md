## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

**Backend:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js)
- [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)
- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (local or cloud, e.g. Render)
- A GitHub account (for cloning and contributing)

## Quick Start

You can get the code by either cloning this repository using Git, or downloading it as a ZIP file from GitHub (click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP").
On GitHub, you can also browse the code, view commit history, open issues, and submit pull requests.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanban-board-with-jwt-auth.git
    cd kanban-board-with-jwt-auth
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for both client and server:**

    ```bash
    npm run install
    ```

    This command will install dependencies for both the `client` and `server` folders at once.
    Alternatively, you can install them separately:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
    Use the appropriate values for your environment:

    **For development (local):**

    ```env
    DB_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_development_secret
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NODE_ENV=development
    ```

    **For production (deployed):**

    ```env
    DB_URL=postgres://your_prod_user:your_prod_password@your-prod-db-host:5432/your_prod_db
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_production_secret
    CLIENT_URL=https://your-production-site.com
    NODE_ENV=production
    ```

    > **Note:** Never commit your real `.env` file to version control. Only commit `.env.example` with placeholder values.

4. **Build the project:**

    - **For development:**
      You typically do not need to build the project; use the dev servers instead.

        - Start the backend and frontend in development mode (see step 6).

    - **For production:**
      Build the frontend for production and ensure the backend is ready to serve static files.

        ```bash
        cd client
        npm run build
        cd ../server
        npm run build
        ```

5. **Seed the database (optional for local dev):**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run seed
    ```

6. **Start the server(s):**

    - **For development:**
      Start both the backend and frontend dev servers:

        ```bash
        # In one terminal (backend)
        cd server
        npm run dev

        # In another terminal (frontend)
        cd client
        npm run dev
        ```

        - The frontend will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
        - The backend will run at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

    - **For production:**
      Start only the backend server (it will serve the built frontend):

        ```bash
        cd server
        npm start
        ```

        - The app will be available at your production URL (e.g., `https://your-production-site.com`)

7. **Open your browser:**

    - **For development:**
      Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

    - **For production:**
      Visit your deployed site URL (e.g., `https://your-production-site.com`)
